client.py (run this)
* client.py handles all communication with the server
* if you see connection.Send({"action": "function"..., that means there is a function on the server as shown below
def Network_function(self, data):
* pygame is not used in client.py

server.py
* stores player data (is encrypted by the client, before sending to the server)
* only interracts with client.py, using the same connection.Send mechanism

game_bit.py
* run by client.py, runs the mainloop() function in game_bit
* game_bit handles the game logic, and calls upon other files (listed below)

player.py
* stores player data, encrypts data using encrpyt.py
* strangely, the class whereami handles the position on the map, this code would be better in the player function
* staticmethods, one client has one player

encrypt.py
* just encryption and decryption functinos, nothing to do with player or pygame or server stuff

info.py
* small file for when they press i

shop.py
* another small file just for the inventory and buying stuff
* interracts with weaqpon class

weapons.py
